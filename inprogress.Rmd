## **Personal Projects**

1. **Calgary Police Crime Statistics** - This dataset was chosen in our first meeting in 2017.  The purpose was to use it as a common source that members can practice R programming techniques.  We decided in the second meeting to use it for a community year project.  

2. **Writing about cities, urban planning, mapping, data visualization & creative coding** led by [Saadiq Mohiuddin](https://saadiqm.com/){target="_blank"} 

3. **A project to design and maintain a standardized, R based, slide presentation format. The project is currently based in Xaringan written by Yihui Xie at Rstudio** led by [Dylan Loader](https://github.com/DylanLoader/CalgaryR-presentation){target="_blank"}
