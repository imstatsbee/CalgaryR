    + Talk 1: **Burning out of Time: Power-Plant Decommissions and Mine Cloures in the Appalachians**, by [Reinaldo Viccini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reinaldo-viccini-guti%C3%A8rrez-40171645?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BzaorgguQRaWnPq6BuyEFLA%3D%3D){target="_blank"} <br><br> For the past 50 years, coal has been the most important fuel for electricity generation in the United States. The power sector on its own consumes 90% of all domestically mined coal and supplies 30% of the nation's energy demand. Facing serious challenges from low natural gas prices, environmental regulation and increasing operational costs, coal-fired power plants are being decommissioned at increasing rates. Similarly, since 2010, coal production has fallen by 28.5% and nearly half of the existing mines have permanently closed.   The purpose of this paper is to investigate the claim that power plant decommissions are causing closures and production declines in Appalachian mines. If decommissions are impacting mines in any way, given the regional nature of coal markets, nearby mines should be the most affected. The empirical strategy begins by testing the assumption that power plants buy local coal. I argue that observed differences in power plant efficiencies, by state and plant size, emerge as a consequence of local coal quality. Next, I estimate the correlations between aggregate electricity generation and coal consumption from nearby power plants on the mine's production (intensive margin) and probability of closure (extensive margin). Results suggest that changes in aggregate electricity generation and coal consumption from the 10 nearest plantâ€™s have a larger impact on the local mine's intensive and extensive margin as compared to plants in further locations. Finally, using an event-study methodology, I estimate the causal effect of a decommission within the 10 nearest plants to the mine <br><br>
    + Talk 2: **Using unsupervised machine learning to tag oil and gas pressure drop methods used in commercial flow simulators**, by [Pablo Adames](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adames-pablo-87149711?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3B71saROFiRceFp2frfFszXQ%3D%3D){target="_blank"}<br><br> Oil and gas engineers rely on flow simulators to design and troubleshoot pipelines, wells, and thus the facilities needed to achieve production and operation targets within the safety and economic constraints.  Commercial software simulators offer a wide choice of calculation methods for the pressure drop and liquid holdup at every point of the system, these are usually referred to as `flow correlations` for historical reasons.  The difference in the numerical results of the simulations can vary significantly as a function of the flow method selected, leaving everything else constant. <br><br>
    Unsupervised classification methods can be used to discover similarities in the results of the flow correlations available. Once the methods are tagged as belonging to a class of methods based on the similarity of the results, `a priory` knowledge can be used to assign meaning and make recommendations on the more consistent classes of methods to use in a particular production scenario.<br><br>
    For this study, Schlumberger's PIPESIM was used to assess 35 different methods on a model built from field data in the public domain, a metric was defined to assess similarity, the machine learning results were compared to the empirical knowledge, and consistent results were identified for this specific production scenario.  The processing of the text files from the simulator and the subsequent statistical analysis and visualizations were done in R and the code is presented in reproducible research format using the package `knitr` and `RStudio`.  The data and files are also available in `Github`.<br><br>
