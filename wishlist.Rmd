**CalgaryR** is looking for a **voluntary speaker** who would like to provide a tutorial, introduce an interesting problem, or build a partnership to work together.   The examples are as below:

* Applications of statistical modelling, data mining, and machine learning techniques
* Anything that R cannot do or R is not efficient on your work
* Techniques needed for big data analysis, management, and data cleaning, etc 
* Software engineerning needed for integrating R in other environment, objective-oriented programming, package development and documentation, debugging, and interfacing with other languages, etc. 
* Advanced techniques in reproducible research, parallel computing, scientific computing, and operational research, etc. 
* Viusalization method and communication
